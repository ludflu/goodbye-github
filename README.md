script to migrate away from github


- [Github does business with and enables ICE](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/github-faces-more-resignations-in-light-of-ice-contract/) (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). 
- ICE is still [jailing innocent children](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/migrant-children-are-still-confined-and-vulnerable-its-a-gratuitous-act-of-cruelty/2020/05/25/8884fc4a-9bb5-11ea-a2b3-5c3f2d1586df_story.html)
- Github employees have [resigned in protest](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/github-faces-more-resignations-in-light-of-ice-contract/)
- I don't want to support Github as long as it enables the morally indefensible collaboration with ICE.
- I've used this script to migrate my [personal source code repos](https://gitlab.com/ludflu) to Gitlab
